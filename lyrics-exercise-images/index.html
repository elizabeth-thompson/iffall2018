		<h1> AMERICAN TEEN </h1>
		
		<h2> Khalid </h2>
		
		<h3> verse 1 </h3>
		<p>Living a good life full of good vibes<br>
		My eyes are on the grey skies<br>
		Saying I don't want to come home tonight<br>
		Yeah and I'm high up, off what?<br>
		I don't even remember <br>
		But my friend passed out in the Uber ride<br></p>
		
		<h3>pre-chorus </h3>
		<p>From the city of the 915<br>
		Where all the girls are pretty<br>
		And they're down for the hype<br>
		All my boys are with me<br>
		Going up for the night<br>
		But who cares, who cares<br>
		'Cause this is our year<br></p>
		
		<h3>chorus</h3>
		<p>So wake me up in the Spring<br>
		While I'm high off my American dream<br>
		We don't always say what we mean<br>
		It's the lie of an American teen<br></p>
		
		<h3>verse 2</h3>
		<p>Maybe the end is near<br>
		But I've been waiting all year<br>
		To get the hell up out of here<br>
		And throw away my fears<br>
		I'm so faded (I'm so faded)<br>
		Off of all the things that I've taken and<br>
		Maybe I'm not really drunk<br>
		Maybe I'm really good at faking<br></p>

		<h3>bridge</h3>
		<p>My youth is the foundation of me<br>
		Living life as an American teen (American teen)<br>
		American teen, oh yeah<br>
		We don't always say what we mean<br>
		When we're high off our American teen<br>
		My youth is the foundation of me<br>
		Oh, I'm proud to be American<br></p>
