	<h1>Feedback for Bersabeh</h1>
	<h2>Libby Thompson</h2>

	<ol>AESTHETIC
		<li>Aesthetic relates well to content/vibe of the show</li>
		<li>Imagery and design support the text (but low contrast between the text and the image)</li>
		<li>Aesthetic is pretty consistent (maybe change middle image if there’s one of him eating with a pink sky behind him//it’s also the only one with Cartoon Network logo on it)</li>
		<li>Not super legible (try bumping up line weight and/or adding a text shadow) (also text comes a little close for comfort to the margins)</li>
		<li>I think type size is good and type face is as well but need heavier line weight/maybe different color/more intentional placement of text within image to make it more legible</li>
		<li>Also look at image quality, I think its gonna look pixelated at the larger sizes as it seems to be on the edge of pixilation already at these sizes</li></ol>
	<ol>STRUCTURE
		<li>Image seems to more of a priority than quote at the moment
			<ol><li>Switch this hierarchy</li></ol>
		</li>
		<li>Design seems to accommodate browser variability fairly well</li></ol>
	<ol>TECHNICAL CHALLENGES
		<li>Just make sure that youre maintaining a high level of contrast between image and text as the text moves through the image with the size changes</li>
		<li>All seems super feasible I think you can do this for sure!</li>
